IMPORTANT: As you implement features, keep the [README](README.md) and `contextfill --help` up to date; they are the documentation.

## Overview

You are working on `contextfill`, a small Go CLI that tells a Claude Code session how full its context window is, so an agent can check before it starts more work. It reads the session's transcript (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session id>.jsonl`) and sums the input side of the latest assistant turn. `transcript/` is the library: finding a session, reading its latest usage, listing its subagents. `hook/` answers Claude Code's PostToolUse hook, telling the model its fill after a commit. `cmd/contextfill/` is the thin CLI over both.

## Documentation

- [README.md](README.md) — what the tool is, install, quick start and exit codes
- [project/](project/) — dated plans, findings and decisions; [project/gotchas.md](project/gotchas.md) holds project traps

## Ground rules

- **This repo is public, and transcripts are private.** Never commit a real transcript or anything lifted from one — prompts, file paths, task descriptions, token figures. Test fixtures are synthetic and built in the test (`transcript/fixture_test.go`).
- **The transcript format is Claude Code's, not ours, and it is undocumented.** It reads only `type`, `isSidechain`, `requestedModel`, `message.model` and `message.usage` from each line, each subagent's `.meta.json` beside its transcript, and from a hook payload `transcript_path`, `agent_id`, `tool_name` and `tool_input.command`. When Claude Code changes one, fix the reader and add a fixture case for the new shape; never guess past a field that's missing.
- **A bare `contextfill` reports, it doesn't print a primer.** This breaks the shared CLI rule on purpose: the tool has one read, and the point is to run it often. `--help` is the primer.
- **Build and install:** `make install` puts `contextfill` in `$GOBIN`; `make hooks` once per clone installs the pre-commit hook (go vet, go fix, gofmt, go mod tidy, tests, `agents check`).

## Working rules

**Understand the why.** If the goal behind a request isn't clear, ask before solving — beware the XY problem.

**Diverge, then converge.** First brainstorm options (create choices), weigh them against the user's goals, recommend one (make choices), confirm, then execute.

**Ambiguity.** If the *code* could go several ways, choose the idiomatic one for the language. If the *requirement* is ambiguous or the question is architectural, stop and ask — don't decide.

**Dependencies.** Avoid them unless re-implementing would be unreasonable; ask before adding one; each is security and maintenance surface.

**TDD, strictly red/green.** Write tests for every case and every new method first, watch them *all* fail, then implement. A test that is green during red tests nothing — remove or rewrite it. If an existing test must change to pass because the behavior or expectation has changed, explain why clearly. Every bug fix starts with a regression test.

**Plans and tasks live in `job`.** Open every session with `job orient` (no arguments), then read `project/gotchas.md` — while reading, prune it: delete any entry that's now fixed, obvious, or a general rule, marking it `rule:` first if it's general. Don't use Plan Mode or ad-hoc todo lists.

**Don't tour the codebase.** Start from the README and the docs (an Explore agent is fine); dig only where the task leads — once you have a specific need, read as much as that need requires.

**Scripts.** Analysis tooling goes in `scripts/` so it can be re-run — check there before writing one.

**Critique before declaring done.** Re-read the original request: is the need actually met? Do lint and tests pass? Are docs updated? What would an expert flag? Fix serious flaws before reporting.

**Tidiness.** No stray files in the repo root; delete transients, and file valuable artifacts (reports, scripts) where they belong.

**Documentation.** Keep the project docs current as you build. Touch the README only when a doc file is added or new users must know.

**Gotchas.** When a project quirk costs you time and no rule predicts it, append it to `project/gotchas.md`. If a rule in this file was wrong or misled you, record that there too, prefixed `rule:`.

**Where these rules come from.** The marked regions are generated and shared across repos via a CLI tool named `agents`; don't edit inside them. If a rule here is wrong or cost you time, say so in `project/gotchas.md` prefixed `rule:`; that is how shared rules get reviewed.

**Local rulings.** A repo-local ruling, or an override of a shared rule, lives in the project-owned head of `AGENTS.md`, above the generated regions — say plainly that it overrides, and link a dated project doc for the why.

## A session

- **Start from the handoff doc in `project/`, if the last session left one, and `job orient`.** A handoff is current only if nothing has been committed since it (`git log` after its date); an older one is history, not a starting point. A handoff the user pastes wins.
- **Unless the user says they're around, assume they aren't.** Make the call yourself when it's safe and a two-way door, queue the rest, and report every decision at the end. While they're around, bring questions as they come up, including ones an agent raises mid-flight.
- **Before starting, say what needs the user's eyes.**
- **The session ends at the user's budget, or when your context passes 40%, whichever comes first.** Then integrate what's in flight, persist what the next session needs in the repo rather than memory, and write the handoff. Where the repo delegates, `project/agents/delegation.md` covers how.

## Git

- Offer to commit when a unit of work is complete and accepted. Rebase onto upstream; ask on real conflicts, explaining the conflict in plain terms first.
- Commit all uncommitted files together — later changes usually depend on earlier ones, and a half-working state helps nobody. Never amend.
- The subject completes "This commit…": present-tense verb first — "Adds…", "Fixes…", "Retires…". Detail goes in the body.
- Pass the message with `-F <file>`, not inline `-m`; the shell interprets `-m` first. Same for `job`: `note`, `done`, `add` and `edit` all take `-F <file>` (`-F -` reads stdin).
- Pre-commit hooks run the formatter and tests. Run them yourself first (see the stack rules).
- Never pipe a gating command (`git commit … | tail`) — the pipe swallows its exit status, so a following `&&` runs even after a failure.
- Before pushing a repo you haven't been working in, check what's ahead of upstream (`git log @{u}..`). Push only commits you made, or ask.

## Principles

Defaults, not laws. When we break one, we do it consciously and say so in the report and the docs.

- **Pragmatism.** Builders, not purists. Practical choices that serve the near-term goal and protect the long-term one.
- **Eat the frog.** No band-aids. Given an easy-but-compromised path and a correct one, take the correct one; fix problems at the source. Keep YAGNI in mind, but when a need is obvious, don't underdeliver.
- **Composability.** Simple, strong components composed into systems — never a monolith.
- **Library + thin executable.** Core logic in a library; the app or CLI is a light consumer, so the core can be reused elsewhere. An adapter that holds a decision rather than wiring one is a bug.
- **Decoupling.** Tight coupling makes testing, debugging and refactoring hard — separate concerns. Separating a model, its storage and its UI is the everyday case: databases and UI frameworks change; today's web app may grow a CLI or mobile app.
- **Just enough abstraction.** One layer around an LLM provider is prudent; a `TextGenerationProvider` above it is not.
- **Readable file sizes.** Aim for files a reader can hold in their head (a few hundred lines; ~400 is the comfortable ceiling). Past ~2k lines, navigation degrades and errors accumulate; splitting also makes functionality discoverable by filename.
- **Comments say why, not what.** Doc comments state *what* concisely; other comments only explain the non-obvious. No change history in comments. Most code needs none.
- **Strongly typed.** Prefer enums, named constants and config over magic strings and numbers; prefer typed structs over dictionaries, even for wire types. Two packages exchanging data across a serialization seam share **one** struct that both import, never a hand-written twin on each side — the type checker cannot see across encode/decode, and two definitions drift. Given a bool and a typed constant, take the typed constant: a bool named for one consequence gets reused to gate the others until it means several things, so name the underlying *fact* as a type and let the behaviors follow.
- **Previews.** Give each UI component a way to render in its various states — a SwiftUI `#Preview`, a demo page, a story — the foundation for tests and for human review.
- **Async by default.** Keep the app interactive during heavy work; surface loading and error states. On the web, prefer progressive enhancement over full reloads.
- **Event streams where they fit.** Append-only logs are auditable, undoable, and time-travelable.

## Stage: BUILD

Pre-launch, zero users, no existing data. Never spend effort on backward compatibility — assume every use is green-field — but flag breaking changes and update the affected tests. Be ambitious: if a feature is important, build it fully now rather than an MVP; balance that against over-engineering and future-proofing.
<!-- agents:end stage-build -->

<!-- agents:begin go@91ab6a -->
## Go

- Before committing: `go fix ./...`, `gofmt -w .`, `go vet ./...` and `go mod tidy`, then the tests you touched. `go fix` converges over several passes — "re-run to apply more" is progress, not failure; re-run until clean before editing code.
- **Run `go fix ./...` before staging, not just before committing.** A pre-commit hook that re-stages `gofmt` rewrites will not re-stage `go fix` rewrites: a file `go fix` changed that is already gofmt-clean commits unfixed, and your working tree quietly diverges from what you committed.
- **Tests that share a database need `-p 1` and a database per agent.** `go test ./...` runs packages in parallel, so packages that seed the same fixtures and truncate the same tables produce a wall of unrelated-looking failures that survives a re-run and reads as a real regression.
- **Schema changes are numbered migrations** in the project's migrations directory (the head names it). Never run one by hand — the binary migrates when it starts or opens the database and records the version; the next run applies it. Read the full note history on the task (`job show <id>`) before writing schema; it is the most expensive thing to change.
- **On SQLite:** **`CHECK` passes on NULL.** `CHECK (a = b)` admits any row where either side is NULL — guard every comparison with `IS NOT NULL`, or it enforces nothing.
- **On SQLite:** **NULLs are distinct in a `UNIQUE` index.** A nullable column in a dedup key admits duplicates forever; wrap it in `COALESCE(col, '')` in the index expression.
- **On SQLite:** **Never hold a transaction open across a model or network call.** `BeginTx` is deferred — it pins a read snapshot at the first read, so the write at the end fails with `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT` if any other connection committed meanwhile, and `busy_timeout` cannot rescue it because waiting cannot refresh a stale snapshot. Split into a step that reads and calls but writes nothing, and a short transaction that persists the result.
- Wire types are structs, not `map[string]any`, unless the shape is genuinely dynamic.
- **`r.ParseForm()` reads a body only when it is urlencoded**; for multipart it leaves it empty without erroring. Keep one wire format per route — a handler that accepts two body shapes needs two sets of checks where the design wanted one.

## Documentation practice

- **Plans, findings, designs and decisions go in `project/` as dated documents** (`YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`) — the written history of the project. They are point-in-time records: correct an earlier one *in place*, as a marked block quote, rather than silently editing a number or leaving a stale claim standing.
- **Every figure names the tool and flags that reproduce it.**
- **Work decided against goes in `project/backlog.md`**, not into silence: one dated H2 per item — what it is, why it's parked, and *what would un-park it*. Nothing there is scheduled or blocking; active work lives in `job`. Check it before proposing something that sounds novel.
- **When a finding overturns a premise, edit the premise.** Readers act on the title and opening; a correction appended underneath doesn't reach them.
- **A wrong documented cause is worse than none** — it stops the next reader looking. Correcting one means saying it was wrong, not quietly rewording.
- **Open the note before you cite it**, and check whether a recorded ruling has been superseded before passing it on.
- **Every repo has a README; if none exists, write one (delegate it if you can).** It is tight: the project's name and a one-line description a non-technical reader understands (6th-grade reading level); one short paragraph of what it is; how to install or consume it; a crisp Quick Start with an example or two; links out to the specific docs for anything more; authorship and license at the end.
- **The head of `AGENTS.md` lists where the docs live; keep that list current.**
